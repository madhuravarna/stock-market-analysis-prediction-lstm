# stock-market-analysis-prediction-lstm
A deep learning project that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices based on historical time series data. Demonstrates data preprocessing, sequence modeling, and evaluation of model accuracy.


This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for time-series forecasting. It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the market’s non-linear and noisy behavior. This project utilizes LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies and make future predictions based on past data.

---

## Dataset

- *Source*: [Yahoo Finance / Kaggle / Alpha Vantage]
- *Data*: Daily stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
- *Time Period*: [e.g., 2010–2023]
- *Target Variable*: Close price

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

---

## Problem Statement

Predict the next day's stock price (or next N days) using historical closing prices, leveraging the temporal learning ability of LSTM networks.

---

## Data Preprocessing

- Filled missing values
- Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler
- Created sliding time windows (X: past 60 days, Y: next day)
- Reshaped data for LSTM input

---

## Model Architecture

- LSTM layers with dropout for regularization
- Dense output layer for regression
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimizer: Adam

---

## Training and Evaluation

- Train-Test Split (e.g., 80-20)
- Evaluation Metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE
- Visual comparison of predicted vs actual stock prices

---

## Results

- LSTM was able to capture short-term trends
- Prediction curves follow real stock price patterns with slight lag
- RMSE: [Insert value]
- Plots show reasonable generalization on test data

---

## Conclusion

LSTM networks are well-suited for time series forecasting. With more features (like news sentiment or macroeconomic indicators), performance could be enhanced.

---

## Future Improvements

- Use multivariate LSTM with technical indicators
- Apply more advanced models like BiLSTM, GRU, or Transformer-based time series models
- Add real-time data streaming and dashboard visualization using Streamlit
